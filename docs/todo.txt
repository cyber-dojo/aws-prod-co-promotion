DONE: Decide on Flow name: prod-promotion
DONE: Create Flow on kosli staging AND prod
DONE: Add KOSLI_FLOW repo-level Github Action env-var

DONE: Make a forced change on saver (eg) and do not deploy to prod.
DONE: Check the "kosli diff snapshots" sees a difference

MVP DONE
--------
- No custom attestation
- Manually triggered workflow
- What is the Trail name? github sha not good. Timestamp?
- [make candidates] runs inside the workflow, prints what it will do as well as creating json files
- How to iterate N times in bash
  for a in $(seq 0 $(( ${artifacts_length} - 1 )))
  doesn't work when artifacts_length==0

MVP DOING
---------
- Figure out how to pass name of all services to matrix
- All deployments in parallel via matrix
- Turn off dry-run

LATER
-----
- do approval for each artifact in parallel via matrix
- do custom attestation on overlapping time-period
   - Does this also get attested on each Artifact? I guess so.
- make workflow reusable, pass in all KOSLI arguments as inputs.


In workflow, each Artifact will need (can these be done in parallel?):

- kosli attest artifact "${KOSLI_FINGERPRINT}" \
      --name=NAME

- kosli attest custom --type=????
      --fingerprint="${KOSLI_FINGERPRINT}"
      --attestation-data=????
      --name=NAME.????

- kosli assert artifact \
      --fingerprint="${KOSLI_FINGERPRINT}" \
      --environment="${KOSLI_AWS_PROD}"


Then each artifact will need:

- kosli report approval "${IMAGE_NAME}"
    --approver="${{ github.actor }}"
    --environment="${KOSLI_AWS_PROD}"

Then each artifact can be deployed.

Create a custom-attestation promotion type in kosli-attestation-types repo.
  Name?
