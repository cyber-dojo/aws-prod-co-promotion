DONE: Decide on Flow name: prod-promotion
DONE: Create Flow on kosli staging AND prod
DONE: Add KOSLI_FLOW repo-level Github Action env-var

Make a forced change on saver (eg) and do not deploy to prod.
  Check the "kosli diff snapshots" sees a difference

Work on candidates.sh

Create a custom-attestation promotion type in kosli-attestation-types repo.

In workflow, each Artifact will need:
- kosli assert artifact ${IMAGE_NAME} \
    --environment="${KOSLI_AWS_PROD}"

Can those be done in parallel?

Then each artifact will need:
- kosli report approval "${IMAGE_NAME}"
    --approver="${{ github.actor }}"
    --environment="${KOSLI_AWS_PROD}"

Then each artifact can be deployed.
